# Cryptocurrency Trading and Analysis Project

## Project Overview

This project aims to explore the basic concepts of cryptocurrencies and trading strategies. It involves setting up a development environment, retrieving and analyzing cryptocurrency data, using major crypto exchange APIs, and designing a database to store collected data.

## Objectives

- Learn the basic concepts of cryptocurrencies and trading strategies.
- Set up the required development environment.
- Perform simple cryptocurrency data retrieval and analysis.
- Use major crypto exchange APIs (e.g., Binance, Coinbase).
- Write scripts for data collection.
- Design and build a database to store the collected data.
- Load initial data into the database.

## Project Components

### 1. Learning Cryptocurrencies and Trading Strategies

- Understanding fundamental concepts of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum.
- Exploring basic trading strategies like the moving average crossover strategy.

### 2. Development Environment Setup

- Installed and configured Python and Jupyter Notebook.
- Set up relevant libraries for data analysis and API interaction, including:
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `yfinance`
  - `binance`
  - `sqlalchemy`
  - `psycopg2`

### 3. Cryptocurrency Data Retrieval and Analysis

- Performed data retrieval using the Binance API and Yahoo Finance API.
- Conducted basic data analysis using Python and Jupyter Notebook.
- Visualized data using Matplotlib.

### 4. Using Crypto Exchange APIs

- Learned how to interact with major crypto exchange APIs such as Binance.
- Implemented functions to fetch historical data and real-time data using the Binance API.

### 5. Data Collection Scripts

- Wrote Python scripts to automate data collection from Binance and Yahoo Finance.
- Collected historical price data for BTC and ETH.

### 6. Database Design and Building

- Designed a database schema to store collected data.
- Built a database using PostgreSQL.
- Created tables to store cryptocurrency prices and trading volumes.

### 7. Data Loading into the Database

- Loaded initial data into the PostgreSQL database.
- Implemented data insertion logic to handle unique constraints and avoid duplicates.
